Installing Ironwood for Smart Pascal

Copy the folder containing the core units to the Smart Pascal \$Library folder.
You can quickly locate this under the start-menu item for Smart.

Secondly, you may want to move the example folder to your \$Projects folder.

A restart of Smart Mobile Studio is required.

Note: Ironwood uses the latest units from the Smart alpha. As of writing (10.02.2017) this is scheduled
to be released within 1-2 weeks.

Ironwood should run fine under older versions of Smart Mobile Studio, however the unit-names needs to be
adjusted for the older RTL.
