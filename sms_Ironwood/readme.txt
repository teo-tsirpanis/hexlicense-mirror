We ask that you consider that we are a small company of only 2 developers; as a small business - piracy has a 
devastating effect on our ability to produce software.
We hope that you keep this in mind and that you dont spread copies of our work.

About Ironwood
==============

Ironwood is our next generation license formula and generator.
It is faster, more accurate and yields far more serial numbers per seed than our previous engine.

Ironwood also introduces some concepts around the tecniques involved, a framework of ideas if you like;
These concepts makes it easier for you to navigate, expand and work with our software.

About Smart Pascal
==================

Smart Pascal is a dialect of object pascal, the language used by product such as Delphi, Lazarus and various other
less known compilers.

Smart Pascal was designed by Jon L. Aasenden and Eric Grange. It is retailed and sold by The Smart Company,
which is a Norwegian registered software company.
The original architect behind Smart Pascal is also the architect of HexLicense.

In short: Smart allows you to compile for JavaScript. So where Delphi or Freepascal emits machine code for various
processors - Smart emits JavaScript that runs on any JavaScript virtual machine.
Smart Mobile Studio allows you to target traditional HTML5, embedded hardware, mobile devices and node.js.
More and more companies are moving their monolithic software (large, platform bound executables) to node.js so they can be
hosted by cloud services such as Amazon or Azure.

Ironwood for Delphi
===================

The Smart Pascal version of Ironwood is made available for customers who wish to use Smart to write cloud software.
Creating a node.js server that scales, clusters and is portable is very easy using SMS.

Note: This source requires that you have access to the latest RTL. This is presently in alpha, but should be
released to the public shortly. Following the update for SMS, a node.js server will also be given to our customers.
We cannot finish the node.js server before the API has settled and is tested properly, hence we have to wait for the
official SMS update.

The Delphi version has sadly seen some delay, this is also connected to Smart since we wanted to release it
more or less at the same date. Since that date has been in flux since xmas, we release the Smart pascal code now.
This allows developers who already own Smart Mobile Studio to take advantage of that.

Focus now is on completing the Delphi version of Ironwood. The node.js server will, as mentioned, have to wait until the
new Smart RTL is in circulation.
